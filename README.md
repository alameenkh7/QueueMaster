# NestJS BullMQ Task Queue with Bull-Board UI

This project demonstrates how to set up a task queue using BullMQ in a NestJS application with an integrated Bull-Board UI. Bull-Board provides a real-time UI for monitoring jobs in queues.

## Features

- NestJS-based task queue using BullMQ
- Bull-Board UI for monitoring job statuses
- Basic Authentication for securing the UI
- Modular architecture for easy integration into other projects

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nest-bullmq-task-queue.git
   cd nest-bullmq-task-queue
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
   ```env
   BULL_BOARD_USERNAME=your-username
   BULL_BOARD_PASSWORD_HASH=your-hashed-password
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. Access the Bull-Board UI:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3011/queues` and log in with your credentials.

## Usage

- Add jobs to the queue through the API by calling `GET /?fail=true/false`.
